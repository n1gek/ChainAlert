# 🚨 ChainAlert

**ChainAlert** is a **silent personal safety escalation system** designed to protect individuals during high‑risk situations such as ICE encounters, detainment, or emergencies.  
Once activated, ChainAlert works quietly in the background and **automatically escalates alerts** if the user cannot check in.

🔗 **Live App:** <https://alert-pi.vercel.app>

## 🛡️ What Is ChainAlert?

ChainAlert is built around a simple idea:

> *When you can’t speak or act, the system acts for you.*

Users activate protection before or during a risky situation. If they fail to check in, ChainAlert triggers a **time‑based escalation ladder** — notifying trusted contacts first and legal organizations later.

No panic buttons. No constant interaction.  
Just **silent, automatic protection**.
